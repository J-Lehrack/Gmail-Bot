# Overview

This application creates a simple and straightforward method to either pull your emails from the gmail inbox or send
an email from your gmail account. This is achieved using the Inquirer package.

## Filtering Mail

The filter method relies on gmail's filtering systems and can be unintuitive in how to reach the mail you want.
For example, beginning and end dates are non-inclusive, and most things are case sensitive.

## Sending Mail

Sending mail is straightforward with a series of prompts to fill in the information to send.
